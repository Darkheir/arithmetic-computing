    It implements common operations in a very basic way:
     * Send data
     * Receive data

    In this implementation the data is serialized before being sent and deserialized after being received
    The serializer can be specified in the constructor. It must implements 2 methods:
        * dumps to serialize data
        * loads to deserialize data

    To control that all the data has been received a very simple mechanism is used:
    Before sending data we calculate the size of the serialized data to send
    and it is added at the begging of the data. This lets us be sure all the data has been send.

    It doesn't replace a real integrity control nor an authentication of the data.
